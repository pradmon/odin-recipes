    <h2>Delicious!!! And I mean, really, REALLY good! </h2>
    <h3>
        <p>his creamy pork stew recipe is one of my favorite cold-weather <br>
         dishes of all time. You can add squash, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, <br>
         mushrooms, or root vegetables — the recipe is quite versatile.</p>
    </h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        
        <li>2 ½ pounds pork shoulder, cut into 2-inch chunks</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>½ cup apple cider or apple juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon prepared horseradish</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>¼ cup chicken broth or more as needed</li>
        <li>4 sage leaves</li>
        <li>2 sprigs thyme</li>
        <li>2 small sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1 dried bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced carrots</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, sliced</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup green peas, fresh or frozen</li>
        <li>¼ cup matchstick-cut apple strips</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season pork chunks generously with salt and pepper. <br>
        Toss to distribute seasonings evenly.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over high heat. Brown <br>
        pork in batches so meat isn't crowded, about 7 minutes per batch. <br>
        Transfer pork to a plate.</li>
        <li>Place onions into the same pot; cook and stir until translucent and <br>
        the edges brown, 3 or 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, <br>
        about 1 minute. Stir in apple cider and apple cider vinegar.</li>
        <li>Increase the heat to high and stir in mustard and horseradish. <br>
        Transfer browned pork pieces back to the pot, along with any accumulated juices. <br>
        Pour in cream and 1/4 cup chicken broth; add more chicken broth to cover <br>
        if needed. Add sage, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf; season with a pinch of salt. <br>
        Bring to a simmer, then cover and simmer over low heat for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add carrots, celery, and cayenne pepper; season with more black pepper. <br>
        Leave uncovered and simmer until meat is tender, about 1 hour. Add peas and <br>
        simmer for 10 minutes. (Optional: for a thicker sauce, raise heat and <br>
        simmer until sauce is reduced, 5 to 8 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Garnish individual servings with apple strips and chives.</li>

    </ol>
